# Pillow.js

Use Pillow.js to transform your data into HTML charts.

Please note Pillow.js is currently in alpha state.

## Dependencies

  - jQuery 1.7+
  - Raphael Light 2.0.1
  - Less 1.6.0+

## NPM package

Installing a NPM package is the preferred way to use Pillow.js.

To use Pillow.js as a CommonJS module (e.g. to use some Node.js tool, such as Browserify, to package your app), you should install the NPM module:

```bash
npm install pillow-js
```

You can then require individual Pillow.js charts:

```javascript
PieChart = require("pillow-js/lib/pie_chart");
```

To use it in your application, you should instantiate a Pillow.js object:

```javascript
pie = new PieChart;
```

## Standalone

All the files you need are in the `build` folder.

 1. Download `standalone.js` (or `standalone.min.js`) and include it in your HTML file.
 2. Optionally, download and include `pillow.css` and img folder for default style (recommended).

## Examples

Look into [demo](demo/index.html) html file.

## Development

  - Node.js 0.10+
  - Source files are located in `src` and `less` for CoffeeScript and LESS, respectively.

```bash
npm install -g gulp
npm install

npm start # or just gulp
```

If you want minified files just run `gulp build` or `npm run build`.
